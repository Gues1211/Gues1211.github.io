Building my first CLI was not easy task and pretty daunting but it become pretty easy the more I tough it out, at this point I feel like I am pretty well grounded in the basic of pure Ruby, but it's incredible of the endless combinations and creativity that I still need to learn to do with the basic that I have so far which is still pretty intimidating.  I heard that learn to code is easy, based on my experience I say it gets easy, lol, but I'll let you find that out yourself.


<h2>The Version</h2>
My first step was deciding the idea and model that I was going to implement, I I recommend to getting that clear first It really made it easier knowing more or less what I want my program to do and to output. I ended making some changes in the middle of my coding that I could of ovoided if i was clear on my idea first. It help being very interrogative with yourself and its good to know what to give precedence to and emphasize mostly on that.

Finding a website that was scraping-friendly took some time, not that I couldn't get the data that I needed from any websites but I would of taken much longer. I was able the scrutinize the website using the inspecting tool in Chrome by right click anywhere in the browser and selecting inspect or Ctrl+shift+I, and by click on the little icon of a box with the little arrow pointing inside of it, I was able to hover over each information and see the elements, class, attr etcâ€¦ With that information I was able to get a better idea of what it was going to take to retrieve these information.

<h2>Structuring</h2>
My second step was structuring my gem and most to the method that I believe that I would need to create, editing my gemspec file and liking all my folders and require libraries and so on.


<h2>CLI Code</h2>
My first approach was building my CLI interface imagining exactly what I wanted more or less my gem to do and output to the user, I stated by building the code that I imaging I will need my CLI that do and later proceed on building it in my scraper class.  I looked at some example of output information from other websites to have an idea of how I want the user to see their requested information. 

<h2>Scraper</h2>
Building my scrapper did not take too long after I was clear on the idea and regulate my scrapping class to what i wanted it to look like but It was tough figuring out the idea. My first two attempt where not successful but the web HTML was very difficult to scrape and it was taking a long time to find out how to retrieve the right information so I ended up changing ideas about 3 time. I could of figured it out but for time sake decide to try a website that was easier. Then finally I invested some time getting my gem to output the information in a readable format.

This project really nailed it for my confidence, even though it was very simple but it was fuffice and robust and understanding what each line of codes are doing was urge.  Now I can imaging  the endless combination I can do using these simple tools, I am so excited to learn more and can't wait to have the skills to be able to make a difference in the world though the web.
